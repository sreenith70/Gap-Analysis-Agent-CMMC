Access to sensitive systems and data is granted through Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), where user permissions align strictly with job functions, minimizing unnecessary access across departments.",
      "llm_explanation": "The context partially addresses the control requirement. The context mentions user identification and password restrictions, access control through RBAC, and the prohibition of shared credentials. However, it does not explicitly mention specific mechanisms used to enforce these restrictions, leaving some aspects of the control unaddressed. Therefore, the context partially satisfies the control requirement."
